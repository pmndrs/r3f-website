title: Managing imperative code
---

Stick imperative stuff into useMemo and write out everything else declaratively. This is how you can quickly form reactive, re-usable components that can be bound to a store, graphql, etc.

```jsx
function Extrusion({ start = [0, 0], paths, ...props }) {
  const shape = useMemo(() => {
    const shape = new THREE.Shape();
    shape.moveTo(...start);
    paths.forEach((path) => shape.bezierCurveTo(...path));
    return shape;
  }, [start, paths]);

  return (
    <mesh>
      <extrudeGeometry attach="geometry" args={[shape, props]} />
      <meshPhongMaterial attach="material" />
    </mesh>
  );
}

<Extrusion
  start={[25, 25]}
  paths={[
    [25, 25, 20, 0, 0, 0],
    [30, 0, 30, 35, 30, 35],
    [30, 55, 10, 77, 25, 95],
  ]}
  bevelEnabled
  amount={8}
/>;
```
